# FRDCSA Integrated Reference Manual


<a id="orgee6333c"></a>

## Introduction


<a id="org8e0e91a"></a>

### Purpose

The FRDCSA (Formalized Research Database: Cluster, Study and Apply) is
a comprehensive collection of custom internal/minor and third-party
external/git codebases designed to address a wide range of complex
problems using artificial intelligence and open-source software. Its
purpose is to create an integrated ecosystem of tools that can assist
in various aspects of theoretical and applied problem-solving and
research.


<a id="org7006f61"></a>

### User Base

-   Researchers and academics in AI, computer science, and related fields
-   Software developers and engineers
-   Students and educators
-   Individuals interested in personal productivity and life management
-   Organizations seeking advanced AI-powered solutions


<a id="org1de5b2f"></a>

### Status

The FRDCSA is an ongoing project with many custom [internal](https://altruisticsoftware.org/frdcsa/internal)/[minor](https://altruisticsoftware.org/frdcsa/minor)
codebases in various stages of development. Some systems are
functional prototypes, while others are in conceptual or early
development stages. They integrate third-party free/libre open source
[external](https://altruisticsoftware.org/frdcsa/external)/[git](https://altruisticsoftware.org/frdcsa/git) codebases.
